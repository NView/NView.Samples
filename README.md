# NView Samples

All samples are contained in their own directory with this structure:

* `Sample.Core` is the portable version of the application.
* `Sample.Android` (optional) is the Android version of the application with a UI built with Layouts.
* `Sample.iOS` (optional) is the iOS version of the application with a UI built with Storyboards.
* `Sample.Mac` (optional) is the Mac version of the application with a UI built with NIBs.

You can run all the samples at once using the `Sampler` sample. Just run it on your favorite platform
and you will be able to select which sample to run (without a custom UI).
